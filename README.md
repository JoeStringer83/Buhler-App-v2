# BuhlerApp

Version 2.0 of the Buhler Developer test. This incorportes several  libraries and techniques discovered after watching Fadi's tutorials on Angular development. It also incorporates reading in values from a json file located within the assets folder. As it was a local file HTTP protocols were used and strict values were turned off to prevent typefacing errors.
